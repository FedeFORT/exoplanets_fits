# Approximate Fits of Exoplanet

This repository contains a Python program created by three students from the Universit√† degli Studi di Genova. It aims to perform a simple fit for the light curve of a planet studied using the transit method.

The program initializes parameters using a smoothed version of the observation points. It then executes a fit using an approximation of the light curve created by Carter et al. (2008). Finally, it provides the desired parameters extracted from the fits.
